observations :
1) path.png :
	in path.png we can observe that by randomizing the movement with prob = 0.2 as only bias against optimal move results in produced path being non-optimal(as expected) .



2) plot.png
 
	we can say probability is determining factor by how much our runner spans the grid, lower the probability higher the span and at 0 prob we get all movements being random, hence very large number of steps required by the runner as he is practically guessing at each step.

	as p increases randomness in determining next move decreases and chances of taking optimal path increases, hence number of step required by the runner decreases

	and at p = 1 we have optimal policy which gives 'one of the path out of paths which have shorted length'.
